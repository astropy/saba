Welcome to AstroSherpaBridge's documentation!
=============================================

I would like to introduce you to the Google Summer of Code project, a brigde between sherpa and `astropy.modelling` this project is to allow astropy users to take advantage of the sherpa package, giving them acess to the fitting routines and uncertainties estimation.
